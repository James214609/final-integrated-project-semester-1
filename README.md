This here is the repository for the Final Integrated Project in Semester 1. We have to create various different elements for the Final Integrated Project: six wireframes, four HTML files, and a GitHub Repo. The three mobile and desktop prototypes I chose to do were the Rooms, Activities and Spa Pages. I recreated four of those six pages using html: Three of them were in mobile format, and one in desktop format (rooms was used in both mobile and desktop formats)
